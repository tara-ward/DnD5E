# COMP 74, Final Project

```
Project Requirements: Vue + Vite Client for a Web API
```
## Requirements

```
Develop a client application that allows users to query the web API that you selected in Lab 9.
```
1. **Framework & Setup**
    o Build the client using Vue + Vite.
2. **API Integration**
    o Allow users to query 2-3 types of data.
    o Use RESTful API endpoints where data types are specified as path components (not query parameters).
3. **Views & Components**
    o Design an appropriate set of Views and Components for displaying and interacting with the data.
4. **Reactive Data & State Management**
    o Use Vueâ€™s reactive data to manage API responses and user input dynamically.
    o Ensure changes to data trigger automatic UI updates without requiring manual DOM manipulation.
5. **User Input & Filtering**
    o Enable users to set request parameters (if supported by the API) to filter results.
    o Use appropriate input types (e.g., dropdowns, radio buttons) to improve usability when selecting
       predefined options.
    o Provide default values for inputs to facilitate testing.
6. **Data Fetching & Updates**
    o Use the Fetch API to send asynchronous requests and dynamically update the page with response data.
7. **Styling & UI**
    o While this is not a web design course, apply CSS to ensure a clean and user-friendly layout.
8. **Code Quality**
    o Format HTML and JavaScript for readability.
    o Comment JavaScript code for clarity.
    o Remove any unused code before submission.
